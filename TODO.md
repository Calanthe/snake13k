### GLITCHES:

- [ ] buggybug
  - [ ] **BUG** if buggybug right side only is on wall glitched wall doesn't appear (if whole bug is on top/bottom wall 2 glitched walls should appear?)
  - [ ] only show it inside the board?
  - [ ] remove the biggest one?


### TRON MODE:

- [ ] better tron mode background
- [ ] eating 'buggy bug' gives 10 points at once and after growing snake by 10 elements it enters tron mode and gives one point every step
- [ ] give a tron bug some tron bike icon

### GAME FEATURES:

- [ ] improve menu/game over text
- [x] buggybug on 2 pixels (can be eaten on any of them)
  - [ ] add 0 in the first column and row, also choose only 7 length bugs
- [ ] better score board
  - [x] countdown for bugs
  - [ ] countdown for food eaten in level
- [x] favicon
  - [ ] favicons are too big (we can have only one if optimized)
  - [ ] maybe generate favicon from canvas?
- [x] game loop during menu/game over for glitch animation
  - [ ] make whole screen glitch a lot after game over and disappear into menu
- [ ] snake disappearing after game over
 - [ ] make is smaller step by step
 - [ ] make it explode into particles
- [ ] separate background canvas (for mobile performance and tron background)

### MOBILE

- [ ] controls
  - [x] just touch on game screen?
  - [ ] some buttons below the screen
- [ ] sound doesn't work at all (user input needed)
- [ ] don't draw all the pixels
  - [x] only draw pixels that are on?
  - [ ] have separate background canvas that is not redrawn?
- [ ] check if getting rid of gradients helps

### CODE:

- [ ] TODOs from code
- [ ] clean up quick and dirty prototyping, remove console.logs
- [ ] check also other browsers like eg IE?

### BUILD:

- [ ] add favicon? (first try to make canvas favicon)
