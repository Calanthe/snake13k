### GLITCHES:

- [ ] buggybug
  - [x] **BUG** fix issue with buggybug on edge
  - [ ] **BUG** if buggybug right side only is on wall glitched wall doesn't appear (if whole bug is on top/bottom wall 2 glitched walls should appear?)
  - [x] **BUG** it happened that only half bug disappeared after timeout
  - [x] more time to catch it
  - [ ] only show it inside the board?
  - [ ] remove the biggest one?
- [ ] **BUG** sometimes food is generated on snake

### TRON MODE:

- [ ] better tron mode background
- [ ] eating 'buggy bug' gives 10 points at once and after growing snake by 10 elements it enters tron mode and gives one point every step
- [x] or tron mode only if bug eaten horizontally

  - [ ] add 0 in the first column and row, also choose only 7 length bugs
- [ ] better score board
  - [x] countdown for bugs
  - [ ] countdown for food eaten in level
- [x] favicon
  - [ ] favicons are too big (we can have only one if optimized)

### MOBILE

- [ ] controls
  - [ ] just touch on game screen?
  - [ ] some buttons below the screen
- [ ] sound doesn't work at all (user input needed)
